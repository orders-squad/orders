# devops-orders
Orders microservice


## How to run the code

- In shell:
```shell
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
python3 run.py
```

- Then in your browser's address bar type this address:
`localhost:5000/api/orders`

If everything works fine, you'll get an `HTTP 200` and a pair of braces`[]`(because the database is empty).
